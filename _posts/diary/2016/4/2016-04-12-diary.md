## Koa.js

### middleware

什么是`upstream`，什么是`downstream` 用js的事件冒泡机制来解释，比较清晰:

**捕获阶段**是`downstream`，**冒泡阶段**是`upstream`

下面是官方文档的解释：

> When a middleware invokes yield next the function suspends and passes control to the next middleware defined. After there are no more middleware to execute downstream, the stack will unwind and each middleware is resumed to perform its upstream behaviour.

> if you're a front-end developer you can think any code before yield next; as the "capture" phase, while any code after is the "bubble" phase.

### JS tricks

- `new`一个实例，如果构造函数不需要传参，则可以不用写`()`。栗子：

    ```js
        var d = new Date;
        // 等价于
        var d = new Date();
        
        var Person = function (age) {
            this.age = age;
        }
        
        var p = new Person;
        console.log(p); // Person {age: undefined}
    ```
