* git stash  
    `git stash` is used to save temporarily your working which don't want 
    to commit immediately and clean your working field to last commit.  
    **PS: `git stash` only save working field and stage**

    - `git stash` or `git stash save 'comment'` to save a stash.
    - `git stash list` or `git reflog show refs/stash` to get existed stash list.
    - `git stash pop [<stash>]` or `git stash apply <stash>` will recover stash, 
        the former will remove itself in stash list while the latter won't. `<stash>`
        like `stash@{0}`.
    - `git stash clear` will clear all the stash stack. `git stash drop <stash>` will 
        remove one stash.
    - if you see stash log with `git log --graph --pretty=raw stash@{0} -3` (if we have a stash) you'll 
        find there're 3 commit. The last one is stash@{0}'s commit, and it has 2 parents, one 
        is the last commit in base, another saves changes in stage, the stash itself saves changes 
        in working field. So, you can diff base and stage with `git diff stash@{0}^2^ stash@{0}^2`, 
        diff stage and working field with `git diff stash@{0}^2 stash@{0}`. **see below what's 
        `stash@{0}^2^`**
        **PS: first parent of the stash is the last commit in base, the second parent is stage**

* what is `^` in git  
    `^` means parent node. For example, `HEAD^` means HEAD's parent commit. `stash@{0}^2^` means stash's 
    second parent's parent.
