* git stash  
    `git stash` can store your current working status in a git stack 
    and then return you current working field to last commit. If you 
    want recover your last **stash**, just use `git stash pop`.

    Of course you may have multiple stash, check which is what you want 
    recover with `git stash list`, then pick one like `git stash apply @stash{1}` 
    which get the **second** stash in the **stash list**.
* git diff  
    diff working field with **stage**: `git diff`
    diff working field with **HEAD**: `git diff HEAD/master`
    diff **stage** with **HEAD**: `git diff --cached [, HEAD]`
* git ls-tree and git ls-files
